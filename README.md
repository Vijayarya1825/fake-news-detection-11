# Fake News Detection Using Python ðŸ“°ðŸ¤–

## Overview
This project aims to detect fake news using Python, leveraging various data science techniques and machine learning algorithms. The created program checks the accuracy of the news and determines whether it is fake or not.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction
- Machine Learning Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Real-time News Validation

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the main script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input the news text**: The program will prompt you to input the news text you want to verify.

3. **Get the result**: The program will output whether the news is real or fake.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered a dataset of news articles labeled as real or fake.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Used techniques like TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.
4. **Model Training**: Trained machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and more.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
6. **Deployment**: Implemented the model in a user-friendly interface for real-time news verification.

## Results
The program achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy] in detecting fake news.
